Okay, so I just saw Havoc and wow, my brain feels like a blender on full speed without a lid, like all the scenes just exploded all over my mind. Seriously, I'm sitting here, knees stuck to my chest on this weird little park bench and my back is screaming at me like it's auditioning for a horror movie itself. Anyway, the movie — like a hurricane, but with more fists and less umbrellas? God, it was loud in there, felt like the popcorn was vibrating right out of my bag, little yellow explosions of buttery chaos in the dark.

The beginning, right? It's like...BAM, right into this chaos. No time for the brain to catch up, and I'm munching loudly trying to follow — popcorn's all stuck in my teeth like the plot stuck in my brain. I think there was a car chase, or maybe two, like someone's cat on caffeine. The theater was this jumble of chewing noises and what felt like an unexpected tidal wave of surround sound that made my bones rattle like old bean bags.

> Did I mention the fight scenes? They weren’t fights, they were symphonies of punch, this weird, violent oragmi - the guy next to me literally gasped like he was watching his child take first steps but like way more intense. It's like watching dominoes made of muscles fall and crash into each other. Insane choreography, almost like you wanna download the movie and watch the movie again just to freeze those moments.

Also, honestly lost track of the plot somewhere between trying to adjust in the cramped seat and someone’s phone ringing with the most annoying ringtone ever. Why does it always happen? Like, you’re at this climax, with the soundtrack going like a herd of wild rhinos and then you hear just this … “Happy” blaring from row twelve. I nearly spilled my over-sized soda everywhere.

Random thought: if this movie was a fruit, it’d be one of those spiky durians. It hits you before you know what to do with it, and then you’re just sitting there in awe, or confusion, or both? My friend Jake said he’d download the movie because he didn’t trust the internet spoilers – wise choice Jake, wise choice.

Doesn't help that I was still thinking about that one scene… the one with the alley, I think? It was like the walls were closing in but also the camera was doing this spinny thing and it made me dizzy or maybe that was the Sour Patch gushes. I have no idea. The ending though — wild. No spoilers, but it’s like I need to recalibrate my brain after that. I say it’s like watching your washing machine take off for space… yeah. That makes sense.

setTimeout(() => { head.explode() }, 1000);
